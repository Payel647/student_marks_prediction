# Student Marks Prediction

This project predicts student exam scores based on study hours using **Linear Regression**.

## Overview
The model learns the relationship between study time and exam performance and estimates expected marks for new inputs.

## Approach
- Supervised Learning
- Simple Linear Regression
- Feature: Study Hours (`Hours`)
- Target: Exam Scores (`Scores`)

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Results
- R² Score: 0.97  
- MAE: ~2.9  
- RMSE: ~3.7  

## Dataset
Kaggle dataset with 96 samples containing study hours and exam scores.
